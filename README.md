# Futuristic Crypto Predictor

## Description
**Futuristic Crypto Predictor** is an upcoming project designed to harness the power of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to predict cryptocurrency price movements. This tool aims to analyze historical price data and various data formats, including PDFs, images, and plain text, to create accurate predictive models for cryptocurrency trends.

---

## Vision
We aim to develop a robust framework that:
- Learns from historical price movements.
- Incorporates technical indicators and patterns.
- Supports multiple data formats (e.g., CSV, PDF, images).
- Provides reliable and insightful predictions for crypto enthusiasts.

## Planned Features
- **Data Integration:**
  - Fetch historical cryptocurrency data from APIs like Binance or CoinGecko.
  - Support for user-provided data in PDF, CSV, or image formats.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Clean and prepare data for model training.
  - Extract relevant information from complex data formats (e.g., OCR for images).

- **Model Training:**
  - Implement ML models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest.
  - Develop DL models like LSTM and GRU for time-series forecasting.

- **Visualization:**
  - Graph predictions alongside historical trends.
  - Provide detailed analytics and insights.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Develop a dashboard for easy interaction with the tool.
